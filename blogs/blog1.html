        <p>Accountability is a powerful thing. Making a commitment to doing something and then holding ourselves accountable to others is one of the most useful tools in our motivation and productivity arsenals.</p>
        <p>So if you’re trying to do anything that benefits from consistency (as most things do) and you’re struggling with finding the motivation to keep going, consider hacking your environment to increase your accountability. You could easily do that by tweeting updates, or starting your own free blog to tell your mum about what you’re working on. It doesn’t matter how small-scale the accountability is - as long as it’s there it’ll work for you.</p>
