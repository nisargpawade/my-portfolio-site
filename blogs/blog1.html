        <h1>How to read Books Faster</h1>
        <p>September, 2021</p>

        <p>since my childhood, I used to read Marathi newspaper as my mother would tell me to read it so that I would know to read Marathi as it was not taught in my school. I used to read the comic strip "chintu" and the sports page as it was colourful and felt appealing.</p>
        <p>Until my 11th class, I didn't know what novels like cause I never read one. Mike had seen Percy Jackson movies but never knew that those were based on real novels written by different authors. There is a small library there is a cover which consists of Marathi books in my home. My mother likes to read books so she keeps a lot of them but I never had any urge to read them. I used to call them "kadambari" it is a Marathi word for novel and she has Mrityunjay, chawa and many related to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and I found them a bit hard to read as they looked too big and thought that they were something complex beyond my intellect. I even knew about "Upanyas" as I encountered them in a chapter on Premchan's life but never knew that these all are the same thing. Then I got to know in my 11th class that these are just big storybooks and that's all.</p>
        <p>But I've always had this bad habit of reading loads of useless stuff, even in my hostel, if I found any magazine then I would go through it till the end in a hope that I will find something interesting, also the magazines were great as I had never seen these many magazines in my life before. They were The Week, India Today, Sports Star, and I can't remember much. And even the newspaper took so long to read, and the useless Bollywood and Hollywood gossip was the absolute timekiller.</p>
        <p> The Value of Delight. It’s the idea that spending extra money to get
            an more delightful experience can be ‘worth it’ if it encourages us to
            do more of the thing we want to do. I’m not advocating spending money
            on apps/books if you can’t afford it. I’m advocating for prioritising
            buying useful apps and books over coffee and takeaway :)</p>
         <p>Accountability is a powerful thing. Making a commitment to doing something and then holding ourselves accountable to others is one of the most useful tools in our motivation and productivity arsenals.</p>
        <p>So if you’re trying to do anything that benefits from consistency (as most things do) and you’re struggling with finding the motivation to keep going, consider hacking your environment to increase your accountability. You could easily do that by tweeting updates, or starting your own free blog to tell your mum about what you’re working on. It doesn’t matter how small-scale the accountability is - as long as it’s there it’ll work for you.</p>
