            - a calender
            - a list
            
            you have to carry it around. It is the master schedule.
            
            when I encounter a new to-do, simply jot it down to your list. Next morning transfer it to calender where it's safe.
            
            1. jot down new tasks and assignments on list during day
            2. next morning, transfer these new items from your list to calender
            3. take couple of minutes to plan your day.
            
            Remember, the goal here is not to squeeze everything into one day at all costs, but rather to find out how many of the tasks listed for the day you actually have time to accomplish.</p>

            <p>- Battle Plan 1: Keep a Work Progress Journal
    
                Make a journal, in morning write down your imp goals for the day and before note if you were able to complete them all or missed some and reason for doing so. it won't take more than a minute to do so.</p>
        <p>The Value of Delight. It’s the idea that spending extra money to get
            an more delightful experience can be ‘worth it’ if it encourages us to
            do more of the thing we want to do. I’m not advocating spending money
            on apps/books if you can’t afford it. I’m advocating for prioritising
            buying useful apps and books over coffee and takeaway :)</p>
         <p>Accountability is a powerful thing. Making a commitment to doing something and then holding ourselves accountable to others is one of the most useful tools in our motivation and productivity arsenals.</p>
        <p>So if you’re trying to do anything that benefits from consistency (as most things do) and you’re struggling with finding the motivation to keep going, consider hacking your environment to increase your accountability. You could easily do that by tweeting updates, or starting your own free blog to tell your mum about what you’re working on. It doesn’t matter how small-scale the accountability is - as long as it’s there it’ll work for you.</p>
